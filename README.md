A self-contained Telegram bot adapter for ioBroker, built around a **visual, no-code menu editor**. Design your bot's menus, buttons, and notifications by dragging nodes on a canvas — no scripting required for most use cases.

## Why this exists

Building a Telegram bot for your smart home usually means writing (and maintaining) a pile of `sendTo()` calls, keyboard layouts, and command-routing logic by hand. This adapter turns that into a visual graph: menus are nodes, buttons are their children, and the whole tree exports straight into the adapter's registry. Change something in the editor, hit save, done.

## Features

- **Visual node editor** — a full [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) graph editor running as its own ioBroker Admin tab. Build your menu tree, wire up buttons, connect to a live ioBroker instance to load/save, or export/import as JSON.
- **Six button types**, all wired up in the editor without code:
  - **Menu** — a container of buttons, optionally with a dynamic title (from a script or a live datapoint), an image, or a permission requirement
  - **Toggle / Number / Text input** — bound directly to a datapoint (on/off, fixed value, numeric keypad, or free-text entry)
  - **Action** — the standard back / main-menu / cancel navigation buttons
  - **Command** — calls a script (via `onMessage`) or fires an HTTP request, with optional Basic Auth
  - **Multi-status** — a single button that cycles through more than two states, each with its own emoji, label, and target datapoint/value
- **Auto-generated menus** — user management, notification preferences, and notification pausing are built in and update themselves automatically; no manual button wiring needed
- **Percent-step / number-range pickers** — pick a value from an inline keyboard (with the current value marked ✅) or tap "custom value" to enter one via a real numeric keypad, including decimals
- **Message templates** — `{{datapoint.id}}` placeholders resolve to live values anywhere in a button's text or confirmation message, including inline math (`{{datapoint.id / 60}}`) and automatic boolean/date formatting
- **Status-dependent icons** — a menu or button's emoji can change based on a datapoint's current value/rules, including comparison operators (see below)
- **Permission system** — per-button/per-menu permissions, a user approval gate for new Telegram users, and an admin menu to manage roles and rights (see "Users & Permissions" below)
- **Notification engine** — `sendTo('telegrammenu2.0', 'notify', { area, type, text })` with per-area/per-type user preferences, grouping of rapid-fire notifications, snooze/pause per area, and optional HTML formatting or link-preview suppression
- **Event listeners** — watch any datapoint and automatically push an interactive menu to every authorized user when a condition matches (value, comparison operator, optional `ack` check)
- **Script bridge** — any `javascript.0` script can register an `onMessage` handler and return `{ text, html, noPreview, menuKey, awaitReply }` to answer a button press, ask a follow-up question, or jump to another menu

## Global settings

A handful of settings apply adapter-wide and live as plain fields on the **`main`** menu (the one with `menuKey: "main"`) — set them via the "⚙️ Global Settings" section on that node in the editor:

| Field | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `buttonsPerRow` | `2` | How many buttons per row for auto-wrapped keyboards (regular menus and auto-menus like the user list) |
| `groupingEnabled` | `true` | Whether rapid-fire notifications of the same type get bundled into one message |
| `groupableExcludeTypes` | `['warn', 'error']` | Notification types that are always sent immediately, never bundled |
| `boolTranslateEnabled` | `true` | Whether `true`/`false` values resolved via `{{datapoint.id}}` get translated |
| `boolTrueText` / `boolFalseText` | `✅ an` / `⛔ aus` | The translated text for `true`/`false` |
| `dateTranslateEnabled` | `true` | Whether ISO date/time values resolved via `{{datapoint.id}}` get reformatted |
| `dateFormat` / `dateTimeFormat` | `DD.MM.YYYY` / `DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm` | The output format for date-only vs. date+time values |

## Users & Permissions

Every Telegram user who messages the bot is auto-registered on first contact with role `guest` and `approved: false` — they see a "waiting for approval" message and nothing else until an admin approves them (via an inline button that appears automatically in the admins' chat). Once approved, permissions are per-user boolean flags (`users.<key>.permissions.<name>`), checked against whatever string you put in a menu's or button's `perm` field:

```javascript
{ text: '🔥 Heating', cmd: 'TG:NAV:HEATING', nextMenu: 'heating_main', perm: 'heating' }
```

A user only sees/can use this if `users.<theirKey>.permissions.heating` is `true`. The special value `perm: 'admin'` instead checks the user's `role` field directly (`users.<key>.role === 'admin'`) rather than a named permission. Admins get a built-in "👤 Users" auto-menu (`source: 'users'`) to toggle any user's individual permissions and role without touching states by hand.

## Advanced examples

**Custom confirmation text** on a percent-step/number-range menu (`confirmMessage` field, separate from the menu's normal opening text) — `{value}` and `{unit}` are substituted with whatever was just set:

```
🌡️ Target temperature set to {value}{unit}.
```

**Sending a notification with HTML formatting and no link preview:**

```javascript
sendTo('telegrammenu2.0', 'notify', {
  area: 'Heating',
  type: 'info',
  text: '<b>Boiler restarted</b>\nSee https://your-dashboard.example for details.',
  extra: 'html,nopreview',
});
```

**Auto-opening a menu when a datapoint crosses a threshold** (`trigger` field on any menu):

```javascript
trigger: { datapoint: '0_userdata.0.Heating.error', value: 'true', ackOnly: true }
```

Pushes that menu to every user with permission for it, the moment the datapoint reports `true` with `ack: true`. `value` supports comparison operators too (`>25`, `<=10`, etc.) — used the same way for status-dependent icons:

```javascript
icon: {
  datapoint: '0_userdata.0.Car.batterySoc',
  rules: [{ value: '<25', emoji: '⚡️' }],
  fallback: '🚗',
}
```

## How it works

```
Telegram ⇄ ioBroker.telegram ⇄ telegrammenu2 (this adapter) ⇄ your scripts/datapoints
```

The adapter listens to your existing `telegram.x` instance's incoming-message state, matches the text or `callback_data` against the menu currently open for that chat, and either:
- **handles it directly** (writes to a datapoint, shows a submenu, runs an HTTP request), or
- **calls out to a script** you registered via `onMessage`, and sends back whatever text/menu it returns.

Menus are stored as plain JSON objects, one per key, under the adapter's own `registry.*` states — this is exactly what the visual editor reads and writes. You can also hand-edit or import this JSON directly (see `registryExample.json`).

## Quick start

1. Install the adapter, point it at your existing Telegram adapter instance (`native.telegramInstance`, default `telegram.0`).
2. Open the **Menu Editor** tab in ioBroker Admin. On first start, a minimal default registry is imported automatically (a main menu linking to Settings → Users / Notifications).
3. Add a **Menu** node, wire up some **Toggle**/**Command** buttons under it, hit **"Save to ioBroker"**.
4. Message your bot with `/start`.

See `registryExample.json` for a worked example (a weather button with a message template, a sub-menu with datapoint-bound controls, and a status-dependent icon) — import it via the editor's "Import JSON" button to try it out.

## Building your own script-backed buttons

Any `Command`-type button can call a script instead of (or in addition to) writing a datapoint directly:

```javascript
// in a javascript.0 script
onMessage('TG:WEATHER:SHOW', (data, callback) => {
  const temp = getState('0_userdata.0.Weather.temperature').val;
  callback({ text: `🌤️ It's currently ${temp}°C outside.` });
});
```

No registration call needed — just set the script's ID and the command string on the button in the editor. The callback can also return `html: true`, `noPreview: true`, `awaitReply: true` (to ask a follow-up question), or `menuKey` (to jump straight into another menu).

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22 (uses the built-in `fetch` for the HTTP-request buttons)
- js-controller >= 5.0.0
- An existing, configured `iobroker.telegram` instance
